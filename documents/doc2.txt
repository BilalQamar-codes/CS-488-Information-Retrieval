Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from data. By training algorithms on large datasets, machines can make predictions or identify patterns without explicit programming. Applications of machine learning include image recognition, voice assistants, and recommendation systems.
